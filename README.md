## ðŸ“Š Business Context

Tromp Luettgen and Terry, a strategic consulting firm, was requested by a major client to visualize market share distribution across multiple product categories. Traditional charts (bar or pie charts) were insufficient to communicate the complexity of hierarchical relationships between categories and subcategories.  

The **Treemap** effectively highlights:

- Relative size of market share for each category and subcategory  
- Visual hierarchy of product portfolio  
- Areas requiring attention or potential growth  

This visualization is suitable for **annual reports, board presentations, and strategic planning documents**.
